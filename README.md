# Overview

## Pages & File-based Routing in Next.js

<p>Quick compare file-based routing which we have in Next.js to standard code-based routing we have in React apps with react-router as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In React.js, route configuration is needed to write React components when using react-router (<code>Switch</code>, <code>Route</code>, ...).
   In Next.js, no extra boilerplate code is required in the file-based routing system. we just simply create component files.
    </li>
    <li>
        The file-based routing system is more intuitive and easier to set up. The react-router system is definitely straightforward but includes new components & concepts.
    </li>
    <li>
        In React.js, File & folder setup do not matter at all. In Next.js, File & folder structure (in pages/folder) influences routes.
    </li>
    <li>
        No differences with navigation, both of them, can navigate between components with <b><code>Link</code></b>.
    </li>
</ul>
